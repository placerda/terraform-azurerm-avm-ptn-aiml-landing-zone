# terraform-azurerm-avm-ptn-aiml-landing-zone

This pattern module creates the full AI landing zone for foundry. For more details on AI Landing Zones please see the [AI Landing Zone documentation](https://aka.ms/ailz/website) including the deployment guide for terraform deployments: [AI Landing Zone Terraform Deployment Guide](https://azure.github.io/AI-Landing-Zones/terraform/).

## Getting started

Start from one of the deployable examples in this repository:

- [default](./examples/default) - Platform landing zone deployment.
- [default-byo-vnet](./examples/default-byo-vnet) - Platform landing zone with an existing VNet.
- [standalone](./examples/standalone) - Standalone deployment without platform landing zone dependencies.
- [standalone-byo-vnet](./examples/standalone-byo-vnet) - Standalone deployment with an existing VNet.

Copy the example that best matches your environment, then replace `source = "../../"` with the registry source when deploying from your own configuration.

## Policy-restricted environments

If your tenant policies enforce restrictions (for example, storage account key access controls), use the same `azurerm` provider settings as the examples:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  storage_use_azuread = true
  features {
    resource_group {
      prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources = false
    }
    virtual_machine {
      delete_os_disk_on_deletion = true
    }
    cognitive_account {
      purge_soft_delete_on_destroy = true
    }
  }
}
```

These settings are used across the examples to help deployments succeed in policy-restricted environments.

## Application Platform handoff

The optional `application_platform` input adds managed-identity Container App workloads, runtime configuration modes, non-secret App Configuration population, a private ACR Task agent pool, and Foundry IQ runtime handoff values without changing the existing landing-zone topology or defaults. Existing consumers do not need to migrate.

The default runtime mode remains `appConfig`, while `populate_app_configuration` defaults to `false`. The module's existing topology is network isolated, so consumers normally populate the exported `application_platform_runtime_configuration` map from a post-provision runner with private connectivity. No secret values are accepted by this interface.

`containerEnv` injects non-secret bootstrap configuration directly into each workload. `none` injects only the workload identity client ID. Every workload gets a user-assigned managed identity; private-registry and optional Key Vault permissions are assigned before the Container App resource is created. App Configuration writes and initial private ACR image pulls include bounded RBAC propagation waits rather than relying only on role-assignment creation ordering.

Container Apps omit `workloadProfileName` by default, preserving Azure's existing Consumption-profile selection. Set `workload_profile_name` to an existing environment profile when targeting dedicated compute; dedicated-only environments require an explicit selection. Profile names must be 1 to 15 alphanumeric or hyphen characters, begin and end with an alphanumeric character, and match an entry in `container_app_environment_definition.workload_profile`.

The `application_platform` output preserves the authorized handoff names inside one Terraform object. It records configured intent and resource handoffs only; it is not evidence of effective network isolation or cross-language scenario parity. Full CAF/legacy renaming of existing resources and Foundry IQ data-plane knowledge-base/source creation remain outside this additive change because either would require a separately reviewed migration or data-plane implementation.
